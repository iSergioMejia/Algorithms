Largest Homogeneus Subsequence (LHS) Algorithm
Divide & Conquer
 Sergio A. Mej√≠a - 2020
Python script for the solution of the problem 
"Select the biggest prefix that is common amongst a set of words"

2 Innocent and 1 D&C variants
'''

'''
Innocent Variant
    Check all possible subsequences [i, j] that are homogeneous and save
    the largest size.

        if k > K:
            K = k
            a = i
    return (a, K)

'''
Innocent Variant 2
    This variant is less efficient because the while is replaced by a for that
    always check until the array's end only counting if is the same.

Auxiliar function for the D&C variant that finds the size
of the LHS in an interval [l, h] that is strictly passing through m

'''
Divide & Conquer Variant
    The array is recursively divided in two sections, finding the LHS in each one
    of them. We also check for a LHS that is passing through this 2 sections
    using the auxiliary function. The longest length from this 3 options is returned,
    with the starting index of the sequence.
