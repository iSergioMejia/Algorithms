Divide into two the required multiplications
    If b is even, i.e. a^4 = a*a*a*a, it can be rewritten as (a*a)*(a*a) where both
    operands are the same, so one of them can be found recursively and multiply it by itself.
    If b is odd, i.e. a^5 = a*a*a*a*a, it can be rewritten as (a*a)*(a*a)*a where two of the operands
    are the same, so one of them can be found recursively and multiply it by it self and then
    multiply it by one a.
